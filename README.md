# daizen.io Parachain based on the Substrate Cumulus Parachain Template


This project is originally a fork of the
[Substrate Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template)
modified to include dependencies required for registering this node as a **parathread** or
**parachain** to a **relay chain**.

This is the Parachain implementation for the project https://daizen.io to empower the sharing economy with blockchain technology.
